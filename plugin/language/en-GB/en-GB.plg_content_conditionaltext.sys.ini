   <h2>Conditional Text plugin</h3>
    <p>
      The Conditional Text plugin allows you to conditionally show or hide the text in Joomla
      content based on a few conditions. What is shown or hidden can be determined by a condition,
      the <em>user group</em>, the <em>user</em>, the <em>author group</em>, the <em>author</em>,
      if the user is <em>guest</em>, if the article is <em>featured</em> or it is shown on the <em>frontpage</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please see <a href=\"https://github.com/thoni56/joomla_plugin_conditionaltext\">https://github.com/thoni56/joomla_plugin_conditionaltext</a> for full documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a quick guide: (use '!' for \"not\" and '||' for \"or\" to form complex expressions for user id, user and author groups)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>{guest} ... {/guest}</em> - Text only shown to guests (non registered users)</li>
      <li><em>{user_group 1} ... {/user_group}</em> - Logged in user in user group 1 will see the content</li>
      <li><em>{user 63} ... {/user}</em> - Logged in user 63 (where 63 is the Joomla user id) will see the article content between the plugin syntax.</li>
      <li><em>{author_group 5} ... {/author_group}</em> - If the author of the article belongs to author group 5, the article content between the plugin tags will be shown.</li>
      <li><em>{author} ... {/author}</em> - Only the logged in author of the Joomla article will see the content between the plugin syntax. There is no need to specify the author id.</li>
      <li><em>{featured} ... {/featured}</em> - The content is only shown if the article is set as featured</li>
      <li><em>{frontpage} ... {/frontpage}</em> - The content is only shown if it is on the front page/menu</li>
    </ul>
